In this project I created an weather app that shows weather according to your city, you can search for your city. I used React JS in this project. I use openweathermap API for fatch the weather.

production level build file also available in repo as : "dist" folder.
<br>
I also want to add a Geolocation for search weather according to your current location, if you have any idea about that, you can make a PR for that.
